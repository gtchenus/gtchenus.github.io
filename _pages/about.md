# Welcome!
I'm a first-year Ph.D. student studying Computer Science at the [Northeastern University Khoury College of Computer Sciences](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/). At the same time, I'm a member of the [DATA Lab @ Northeastern](https://db.khoury.northeastern.edu/), working with [Mirek Riedewald](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/people/mirek-riedewald/), [Ren√©e Miller](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/people/renee-miller/), and [Wolfgang Gatterbauer](https://gatterbauer.name/). My research interests lie in databases and distributed computing, with an emphasis on scalable data management for data lakes.

Before starting my journey at Northeastern, I obtained my M.Sc. in Computer Science at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/) and B.Eng. in Information Security at [Beijing University of Technology](http://www.bjut.edu.cn), China. 

Apart from computer science, I'm passionate about outdoor activities. I love alpine skiing, basketball(huge fan of Lebron), mountain biking, dogs, and bagels!
