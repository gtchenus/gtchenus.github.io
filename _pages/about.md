# Welcome!
I'm currently a second-year master student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.bu.edu/cs/) at [Boston University](http://www.bu.edu/). I'm also glad to be a member of [MiDAS](https://midas.bu.edu/) working with [Subhadeep Sarkar](https://subhadeepsarkar.bitbucket.io/), advised by [Manos Athanassoulis](http://cs-people.bu.edu/mathan/). I found my research interests related to data structures in the area of data systems, including efficient access methods and storage management for heterogeneous workloads. 
For now, i'm researching on different compaction policies of [Log-structured merge-tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-structured_merge-tree) on modern NoSQL key-vale data systems.

Before starting my journey at BU, I had some industry experience at local technology companies in Beijing and I recevied my B.Eng. degree on Information Security at [Beijing University of Technology](http://www.bjut.edu.cn), China. 

Beyond the field of computer science, i'm passionate about learning new things in life. I love skiing, basketball(huge fan of Leborn James), music, dogs, and bagels!
