# Welcome!
I'm currently a second-year master student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.bu.edu/cs/) at [Boston University](http://www.bu.edu/). I'm also glad to be a member of [MiDAS](https://midas.bu.edu/) working with [Subhadeep Sarkar](https://subhadeepsarkar.bitbucket.io/), advised by [Manos Athanassoulis](http://cs-people.bu.edu/mathan/). I found my research interests related to data structures in the area of data systems, including efficient access methods and storage management for heterogeneous workloads. 

For now, i'm researching on different compaction policies of log-structured merge-tree on modern NoSQL key-vale data systems.
